Project Overview
This project is a mobile application built with Flutter framework, Dart programming language, and Firebase as the database. The application, Raider One, integrates two primary applications: Raider Eats and Raider Ride.

Raider Eats is a food delivery app that allows sellers on the Texas Tech University campus to have students order online, making it easier for customers to order and receive food from their desired restaurants.

To fulfill its total functionality, Raider Eats is composed of three subtotal applications: the Sellers App, the Delivery App, and the Customers App. The Sellers App is exclusively for restaurant owners who want to sell their food through the application, while the Delivery App is designed for drivers who want to offer their delivery services to sellers. The Customers App is for students who want to order food from their favorite restaurants.
